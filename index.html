            Enchanting is a mechanic that augments armor, tools, weapons, and books with one or more of a variety of "enchantments" that improve an item's existing abilities or imbue them with additional abilities and uses.

            There are three ways to enchant an item in Survival mode:

            Through an enchanting table in exchange for experience points and lapis lazuli. Only unenchanted items may be enchanted this way.
            Through an anvil, combining an enchanted book with an item.
            Through an anvil, combining two of the same item with different existing enchantments into a single item that has the enchantments of both.
            A player may also obtain items already enchanted:

            Through a villager, who may trade some enchanted items for emeralds.
            Through fishing, which gives a chance of obtaining enchanted items.
            Through a zombie, drowned, husk, piglin, skeleton, stray, wither skeleton, and zombified piglin – if they have enchanted items and the player kills them, it has an 8.5% chance of them dropping each said item.
            Through finding them in end cities and other assorted treasure chests, such as shipwrecks, mineshafts, dungeons, desert temples, jungle temples, woodland mansions, ocean ruins, strongholds, ruined portals, and bastion remnants.
            Bartering offers an enchanted book or iron boots.
            Through killing pillagers and vindicators in raids.‌[Bedrock Edition only]
            Server operators and players in singleplayer worlds with cheats enabled can also enchant items using commands such as /enchant. When enchanted with the /give command, the maximum enchantment level is 2,147,483,647‌[Java Edition only]. In Creative mode, items can be enchanted via an anvil and enchanted books, with no experience points required. Enchanted books are available in the Creative mode inventory, with individual book displays for the highest level of each enchantment and other levels available via the "Search" tab.


            An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item in the input slots and 1–3 Lapis Lazuli in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the "Efficiency II" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.

            Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30-50 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, pays only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.

            The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are "maximum strength" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example.

            To increase the enchantment level, bookshelves should be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of air between them. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a total of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the enchantment mechanics page for more detailed information on this.

            Enchanting a book produces an enchanted book, which does nothing on its own, but effectively "saves" the enchantment for later application to another item with an anvil.

            Unlike with an anvil, using the enchanting table while on Creative still costs experience. However, if the player doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero.</p>

            A mob is a living, moving game entity. The term "mob" is short for "mobile".[1] All mobs can be attacked and hurt (from falling, attacked by player or another mob, falling into the void, etc.) and some of them can drown or burn. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and loot.

            Mobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on their light level, habitat, and their surroundings, for example, most animals are found in brighter, outside areas whilst hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether if it’s a cave, dungeon, mansion or at night). These mobs usually spawn upon chunk generation. Most animals including those that are passive, neutral, and even hoglins have the ability to be bred by the player, creating offspring. Villagers also breed randomly depending on the time and the number of beds (though they can’t be bred by the player). Mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other aquatic creatures), in lava (except for striders), on bedrock, or on blocks less than a full block tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners, from which they can spawn naturally on any block including air.

            Some mobs (like the snow golem, and the wither) require that the player needs to "construct" them before being able to spawn. The iron golem can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with 4 end crystals.

            Players can also spawn mobs easily by using spawn eggs in Creative mode, or the /summon command.

            Mobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player: they are subject to physics, and they can be hurt by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning, attacked by weapons, /kill, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. Mobs like cod, salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish, drowned, guardian, elder guardian cannot be drowned. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders. When mobs are killed, they turn to dust and drop items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (Artificial Intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player nearby and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced pathfinding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attack the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks (spherical) away.

            Most mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as ice, glass, tall grass, or glass panes. Mobs do not attempt to walk on rail tracks unless pushed on by other mobs.</p>

        <p>



            Blocks are the basic units of structure in Minecraft that can be directly placed in the game world.

            Blocks are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid of 1-cubic-meter cells. Each cell usually contains exactly one block; exceptions exist in the form of slabs, vines, snow layers, turtle eggs and sea pickles.

            Together, blocks and fluids build up the in-game environment, and most can be harvested and utilized in various fashions. Some blocks, such as dirt and sandstone, are opaque and occupy their entire cubic meter, while other blocks, such as glass and flowers, are transparent or non-solid. Explosions destroy some blocks more easily than they destroy others.

            Air is a special block. It is an unbreakable transparent block, as a substitute for the absence of blocks. in Java Edition, it has two variants: cave air and void air.

            Some blocks, such as torches and glowstone, emit light. The amount of light they emit varies widely; see this table of light values for further information. Opaque blocks completely block light, while transparent blocks can have no effect on light, block the light, or merely weaken it.

            Almost all blocks ignore gravity, with the exception of sand, red sand, gravel, anvils, dragon eggs, concrete powder, scaffolding, and snow.‌[Bedrock Edition only]

        <p> Crafting is how the player makes items and blocks in Minecraft. To craft something, a player moves items from their inventory to a crafting grid, arranging them according to a recipe. A 2×2 crafting grid can be accessed from the player's inventory and a 3×3 grid can be accessed by using a crafting table.

            Players in Creativ[Bedrock Edition only], Survival or Adventure always have access to the 2×2 crafting grid from their inventory screen. Crafting recipes that are at most 2×2 can be made there. These include wood planks, sticks, crafting tables, torches and some shapeless recipes. To craft items using a 3×3 grid, create a crafting table, place it in the world, and press use while facing it. This brings up an interface with a 3×3 crafting grid, which the player can use to craft any crafting recipe in the game.

            Some recipes do not require their ingredients to be arranged in a specific way on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as shapeless recipes. For example, players can craft a fermented spider eye by placing its ingredients anywhere within the grid.[note 1]

            On the other hand, many recipes must have their ingredients placed in the correct relative positions on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as shaped recipes. Ingredients in shaped recipes can be ‘moved’ up, down, left, or right. They can also be flipped side-ways. For example, a 3×1 recipe, such as bread, can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3×3 grid, but it cannot be made using the 2×2 grid because it needs to be three items wide, and a bow may be made with the strings placed on the left instead of on the right.

            There are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way. These are commonly known as fixed recipes. Fixed recipes can be added by data packs or mods. A diamond pickaxe is one example of a fixed recipe. Other examples would be things like crafting resource blocks.
        </p>
        <p> By placing at least one or more water bottles in the lower three slots of the brewing interface, an ingredient in the upper slot, and blaze powder in the fuel slot, a player can distill the ingredients into each bottle and brew potions that may be consumed to grant an effect to
            the player.

            Every potion starts with a water bottle, made by filling a glass bottle at a water source or filled cauldron. The next step is to add a base ingredient to create a base potion, usually nether wart is used to create an awkward potion, and adding blaze powder to the fuel slot. By brewing an effect ingredient into the awkward potion, in the same manner, the player can create a potion with a working effect. A modifier ingredient (glowstone dust, redstone dust, or fermented spider eye) may be added to make the effect more intense or last longer or change the effect entirely. Gunpowder can be added to a potion at any stage to convert it to a splash potion, which can be thrown (or fired using a dispenser) to affect all players and mobs in a radius. Dragon's breath can be added to a splash potion to convert it to a lingering potion, which can be used to create a cloud that grants an effect as long as it remains. Each brewing step takes 20 seconds.

            Each piece of blaze powder used provides fuel for brewing 20 batches of potions. Fuel is consumed when a brewing operation starts and it is not recovered if the operation is halted prematurely by removing the ingredient or potion bottles.

            Corrupting effect: A fermented spider eye changes a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion.

            A corrupted potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.
            Corrupting an enhanced or extended potion into an effect that supports the modifier results in a potion with the same modifier applied.
            Corrupting an enhanced potion of Poison/Healing results in a basic potion of Harming. Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted.

            A potion of Invisibility is considered a "corrupted" version of a potion of Night Vision.
            Splash and lingering potions: Any potion can be turned into a splash potion, and subsequently, a lingering potion. Splash and lingering potions can be used best for affecting other entities.

            Splash potions and lingering potions can be modified in the same manner as their normal counterparts. For instance, a splash water bottle can be brewed with any of the base ingredients; the result remains a splash potion.
            In Bedrock Edition, splash potions' effects have only three-fourths of the duration of the drinkable form. For example, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 6:00 as a splash potion. In Java Edition, splash and drinkable forms have the same duration.
            Lingering potions have only one-fourth of the duration of the drinkable form. For instance, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 2:00 as a lingering potion.</p>
